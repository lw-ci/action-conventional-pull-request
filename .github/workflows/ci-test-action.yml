            Hey there and thank you for opening this pull request! üëãüèº

            We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.

            Details:

            ```
            ${{ steps.test-action.outputs.report }}
            ```
